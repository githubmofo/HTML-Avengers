<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today.
  The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. I said, "we'd lose". You said, "We'll do that together too."
  And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the 
  Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers. Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called 
  the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.
  Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill 
  guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course
  for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.</p>

<p>But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow.
  And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one.
  But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks,
  and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you.
  Because it's always you. You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything 
  I buy her. We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring
  you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense? Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was 
  moments ago] Thor? Thor! No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories.
  I want to see everything. Well, it's just... Sir, the box is glowing and, to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling
  that great.</p>

<p>The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.
  Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for
  me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. Sire, the file
  appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.
  His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there.
  Some idiot with an axe. Look...It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent,
  I'm telling you, you're in no condition.</p>
